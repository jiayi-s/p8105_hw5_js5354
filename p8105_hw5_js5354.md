``` r
# create a dataframe containing all file names
participant_files = as.data.frame(list.files(path = "./data")) 
# rename column
colnames(participant_files)[1] = 'path' 

# create a function to read in data for each subject 
read_participant_files = function (path) {
  df = 
    read.csv(str_c("./data/", path)) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    as.data.frame()
  
  df
}

# saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe
participant_data = 
  map(participant_files$path, read_participant_files) %>% 
  bind_rows()

participant_data =
bind_cols(participant_files, participant_data)
```

``` r
# transform the dataframe to be longitudinal using gather
# clean up variable names
participant_data = 
participant_data %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = value, week_1:week_8) %>% 
  separate(path, into = c("group", "appendix"), sep = "_") %>% 
  separate(appendix, into = c("ID", "remove_1"), sep = 2 ) %>% 
  separate(week, into = c("remove_2", "week"), sep = "_") %>% 
  select(-remove_1, -remove_2) %>% 
  mutate(group = as.factor(group)) %>% 
  arrange(group, ID, week)


# Is it necessary to spread the dataset?? 
```

``` r
participant_data %>% 
  group_by(ID) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = as.numeric(week), y = value, color = ID)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(.~group) +
  labs(title = "Observations on each subject over 8 weeks", 
       x = "week",
       y = "Value of observations")
```

On week 1, the mean observation values for the control group was 0.92 and that of the experimental group was 1.14. Though both the control arm and the experimental arm started off around 1, values in the experimental arm showed a significant increase over the 8-week course and ended up around 5.12 on average. On the other hand, the observation values of the control arm stayed relatively steady over time.
